    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[based on Official documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)\n",
    "[and based on Tower  documentation](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/command-line/basics/basic-workflow#start)  \n",
    "Commercial Git training lasts 3 days. So this introduction will not cover all Git functionalities.  \n",
    "Online there are plenty of tutorials on advanced Git usage.  \n",
    " \n",
    "This introduction will proceed through four sections:\n",
    "1. Git introduction and main commands  \n",
    "2. Branching  \n",
    "3. Local & Remote Repositories  \n",
    "4. Development workflow for the CTA pipeline  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "In 2005 the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) start to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:\n",
    "* **Speed**\n",
    "* Simple design\n",
    "* **Strong support for non-linear development** (thousands of parallel branches) Fully distributed\n",
    "* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to:\n",
    "* revert files back to a previous state.\n",
    "* revert the entire project back to a previous state.\n",
    "* compare changes over time.\n",
    "* see who last modified something that might be causing a problem.\n",
    "* see who introduced an issue and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed Version Control Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In a DVCS, clients fully mirror the repository. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cta-lapp.in2p3.fr/images/distributed.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, DVCS deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Installation and configuration\n",
    "[Follow official documentation: Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Add username and email to git config\n",
    ">  \\$ _git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"_  \n",
    ">  \\$ _git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com_  \n",
    ">  \\$ _git config --global core.editor emacs_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \\$ _git help command _   \n",
    ">  \\$ _git command --help_     \n",
    ">  \\$ _man git-command_  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Get a Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a Git project using two main approaches:\n",
    "* Take an directory (with or without file) and import it into Git.  \n",
    "* Clone an existing Git repository from another server.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Import an existing directory into Git\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \\$ *mkdir /tmp/test_git*        \n",
    ">  \\$ *cd /tmp/test_git*  \n",
    ">  \\$ _**git init**_   \n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files  \n",
    "At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.\n",
    " \n",
    ">  \\$ _git status_  \n",
    " \n",
    "#### The basic Git workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You create or modify files in your working directory.\n",
    "2. You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.\n",
    "3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Three States\n",
    "Git has three main states that your files can reside in:  \n",
    "* **committed**: the data is safely stored in your local database\n",
    "* **modified**: you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet\n",
    "* **staged**. you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Three  Sections \n",
    "* **the Git directory**: where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer  \n",
    "* **the working directory**: single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify\n",
    "* **the staging area**: a file, generally contained in your .git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the “index”, but it’s also common to refer to it as the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "These, conceptually, are the steps you will follow in contributing to ctapipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inform your local copy of ctapipe about the latest changes in the development version with:.  \n",
    ">  \\$ *git fetch  ctapipe*  \n",
    "* Make a new feature branch from the official master; you will make your changes on this branch.    \n",
    "> \\$ git branch hillas ctapipe/master   \n",
    "> \\$ git checkout hillas  \n",
    "* Let your github account know about this branch  \n",
    "(since git 1.7.11 the default push policy is now 'simple' :push only the current branch, and only if it has a similarly named remote tracking branch on upstream). \n",
    "> \\$ git push -u username_repo hillas\n",
    "* Install your branch.  \n",
    ">  \\$ *python setup.py develop*  \n",
    "* Add/remove/modify files for your contribution\n",
    "* Add unit test\n",
    "* Test your modifications and verify all other tests still pass\n",
    "> \\$ make test\n",
    "* Push to your github repository\n",
    ">  \\$ git push\n",
    "\n",
    "* From GitHub, Ask for your changes to be reviewed to let the ctapipe maintainers know you have contributions to review.  \n",
    "1.Go to the URL of your fork of Astropy, e.g., https://github.com/your-user-name/ctapipe.  \n",
    "2.Use the ‘Switch Branches’ dropdown menu to select the branch with your changes  \n",
    "3.Click on the ‘Pull request’ button:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Revise and push as necessary in response to comments on the pull request. Pushing those changes to GitHub automatically updates the pull request.  \n",
